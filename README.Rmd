# Overview

This is the code accompanying Robertson et al. (Submitted) where we estimated that inland recreational fisheries in the US harvest 16 - 43 times more fish than are reported to the FAO.

# Code purpose and order

This code is intended to allow readers/reviewers the ability to repeat analyses in the paper.

1. The first script to run is `Preparing_CreelCat_Data`. This script will load the csv files downloaded from the [CreelCat database](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/CreelCat/) and then prepare them following methods described in detail from [Robertson et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/fme.12650) to be used in the CreelCatch model.

2. The second script to run is `Downloading_NHD_Data`. This script will load NHD data from every state and format it to be used for projections in a later script.

3. The third script to run is `Running_CreelCatch_Model`. This script will use the CreelCat data within the `CreelCatch` model to estimate parameters relating fishing effort and catch, which will be used to project national harvest.

4. Finally, the last script is `Projecting_US_Harvest`.  This script will use model outputs and the NHD data to project effort, catch, and harvest across waterbodies in the US.
